## ⚠️ Critical Code - Do Not Modify

The following code areas are critical to the application's functionality and should not be modified without explicit approval:

### User Authentication & Profile

- Avatar handling and display
- User session fields and types
- Authentication logic and routes

### Database Schema

- User model fields
- Existing table relationships
- Field types on existing models

## Making Changes

1. Always create a new branch for your changes
2. Never modify the critical areas listed above
3. Focus changes only on the specific feature/fix you're working on
4. If you think you need to modify a critical area, discuss it first

## Development Workflow

When making changes:

1. Keep changes focused and minimal
2. Don't touch files/code unrelated to your task
3. Test thoroughly before committing
4. Document any new features or changes
